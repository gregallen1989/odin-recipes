HTML Tutorial Project

This is my first HTML project that I completed while going through the Odin Project. I already knew basic HTML/CSS and even Javascript at the time but I decided to start from zero and pretend like I knew nothing and go through all the tutorials just in case I was missing some underlying knowledge. 

This is as basic as a project as they come. Just basic HTML that uses links, images, and lists and thats about it. Took me maybe 10 minutes to build.

I did learn some things. I hadn;t used Git or GitHub much before this so setting up a repository was a new experience. Overall this made me excited to keep going but really hungry for getting into the more advanced aspects like JavaScript.
